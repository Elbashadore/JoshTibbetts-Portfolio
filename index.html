            About Me
        </h1>
        <p>I have a little bit of a non tradtional entry into development. I have my bachelors degree in Recording arts, while working on my undergraduate degree I found myself working on a lot of video games.
            Through these I was exposed to coding using C# and C++ among other languages. While I found the challenge of coding challenging I realized I love to code. After finish my undergraduate I now work at a company called Zeotek where I work as a data analyst and devloper.

            Outside of my professional life I love to travel and spend time working on music.
